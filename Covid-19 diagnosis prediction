 COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS PREDICTION model take the input from the user for their details and shows a list of symptoms which they may be experiencing. 
On the basis of their entered choices the received input will be processed and their result will be show to them.
A Machine Learning Model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection.
The model is then used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity. Three ML models, namely, Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), and Linear Support Vector Classifier Support Vector Classifier (SVM), were trained and tested on the datasets. 
COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS PREDICTION which cannot be directly used for machine learning models.
The Covid-19 diagnosis prediction is an interactive clinical assessment tool that will assist individuals deciding when to seek testing or medical care if they suspect they or someone they know has contacted COVID-19 or has come into close contact with someone who has COVID-19.
The tool asks a series of questions, and based on the userâ€™s responses, provides result and probability to have the coronavirus.
Helps you quickly find information about the new corona virusand COVID-19, the disease it causes.Overall, based on the nationwide data publicly reported, we developed a model that detects COVID-19 cases by simple features accessed by asking basic questions.
Our frame-work  can  be  used,  among  other  considerations,  to  prioritize  testing for COVID-19 when allocating limited testing resources.COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS PREDICTION model serve as a clinical decision support system. 
Furthermore, the outcomes could reduce the issue of patient overcrowding, and reduce mortality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic.
